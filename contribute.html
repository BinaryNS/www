        <h2>How do contribute models?</h2>
        <p>
          The short answer is: you can't right now. We are in the 
          process of setting up this site, so there isn't any infrastructure
          for that yet. Having said that, if you are
          really interested in contributing now, please don't hesitate to
          <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~knarf/index.html">contact</a> us
          and we go from there.

        <h2>How do I make changes to this website?</h2>
        <p>
          This website it hosted by Github, and so is the repository
          backing it: <a href="https://github.com/BinaryNS/www">
          https://github.com/BinaryNS/www</a>. One way to contribute
          changes here would be to fork and to create a pull request.
          The other option is to request write access to this repository.

        <h2>How do I make changes to the scientific software used here?</h2>
        <p>
          That depends on the particular piece of software. Most of the
          software used here is developed and maintained elsewhere, which means
          you have to go and ask there. However, there are some scripts used to
          run <a href="http://www.lorene.obspm.fr">LORENE</a> to get input files for the
          <a href="http://einsteintoolkit.org/">Einstein Toolkit</a>, and those are
          maintained here, and you can find them on github:
          <a href="https://github.com/BinaryNS/LoreneBNScripts">
